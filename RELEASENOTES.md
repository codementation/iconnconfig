* what works
  * Searching for devices on all alsa ports
  * Setting the device name
  * Setting the network parameters
  * Setting the routes
  * Storing all settings to FLASH
  * Reading all setting from FLASH (1)
  * Restore current configuration to factory default (1)

* known problems
  * in general error handling is currently nearly not implemented. I still don't have a concept
  * (1) after reading the settings from flash or restoring to factory default, the application might crash - I'm still not sure what the problem is.
