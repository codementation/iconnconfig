# Following packages must be installed

## Linux
at least 
* qt5.2 development packages
* libasound2-dev
* libclalsadrv-dev
* libusb-1.0-0-dev

Surely some more...

## compile
* change to this directory
* qmake
* make

There might be errors because of missing additional development packages. As I do not have a 'clean' system around, I can not test it. Please create an issue for such errors, so I can add dependencies.
